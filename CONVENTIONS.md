------

* Use only format() method to formatting strings.
* `print` is a function, `from __future__ import print_function`.

* All Python files MUST use the Unix LF (line feed) line ending.
* All Python files MUST end with a single blank line.


Classes
-------

* Class names MUST be declared in `StudlyCaps`.
* Method names MUST be declared in `camelCase`.
* Property/Method names MUST start but not ending with
  TWO underscores `__` to indicate private visibility.
* Property/Method names MUST start but not ending with
  ONE underscores `_` to indicate protected visibility.
* `exception` module SHOULD contain all `Exception` class.
* You can put an `Exception` definition at the end of a file
  if the file is the only one that uses that exception.
* Every `Exception` class MUST end with `Exception`.


Example
-------
```Python
import sys;

from pymfony.component.kernel import Kernel;

class ClassName():
    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
        """Python magic method"""
        self.propertyName = "{1}".format("Public property");
        self._propertyName = arg1; # Protected property
        self.__propertyName = arg2; # Private property

        print(self.propertyName, end="", file=sys.stderr);

    def methodName(self):
        """Public method"""
        pass;

    def _methodName(self):
        """protected method"""
        pass;

    def __methodName(self):
        """private method"""
        pass;

class ClassNameException(Exception):
    """A ClassName Exception"""
    pass;

```


String
------

* Double quotes for text
* Single quotes for anything that behaves like an identifier
* Double quoted raw string literals for regexps
* Tripled double quotes for docstrings
